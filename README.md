# Motivation
Food security is one of the biggest problems in Africa. Most African countries are yet to become independent on food supply. One of the reasons for this is because of the lack of utilising technology. One of the technologies that can be utilised in the internet of things(IOT). IOT involves using sensors to collect data from an environment and sending that data to a cloud platform for analysis. Often the analysis of this data may involve machine learning that will enable us to get some valueble insights from the data.

# Project Description
Design an IoT-enabled system that will manage plant irrigation to optimize water use. Use lowcost hardware to interface with sensors, collect the data on the cloud, and determine when and how the plants are watered

# Week 1
During the week of October 10, 2023, the Farmwise team made significant progress on the
development of their IoT-enabled irrigation system. The team began by brainstorming and
discussing various aspects of the project, including:
- Which IoT analytics platform to use to analyze the sensor data
- Which environmental conditions to take into account
- How and whether to incorporate machine learning into the project
- Whether to focus on a single crop or a wide range of crops
- Whether to incorporate weather forecast data into the team's data
