# Motivation
Food security is one of the biggest problems in Africa. Most African countries are yet to become independent on food supply. One of the reasons for this is because of the lack of utilising technology. One of the technologies that can be utilised in the internet of things(IOT). IOT involves using sensors to collect data from an environment and sending that data to a cloud platform for analysis. Often the analysis of this data may involve machine learning that will enable us to get some valueble insights from the data.

# Project Description
Our project seeks to use sensors such as soil moisture sensor, temperature sensor and humidity sensors to collect data using low cost hardware such as arduino and send this data to a cloud platform such as thingspeak for analysis and data presentation using graphs and a web inteface

Steps that we have already done:
- We have simulated the project on wokwi
- We have distributed tasks among the 4 team members
